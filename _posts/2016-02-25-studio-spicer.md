Located in the heart of Stratford-upon-Avon, Studio Spicer Architects provide full architectural services for residential, commercial and community projects. The innovative approach to problem solving and often creative re-use of buildings ensures a considered and practical solution to each client's requirements.

Our understanding of architecture and the built environment has been heavily informed from working with existing buildings, repairing, altering and remoulding existing physical forms, set in an existing context. Understanding how buildings and their form and mass, set in human environments, has informed the approach to crafting and producing a new intervention to our existing physical landscape.

Our approach to inventive and innovative solutions creating ambitious and enthusiastic architecture does not limit itself to bespoke and individual clients. This philosophy and knowledge has proven commercial viability in adding value and distinctive quality to an agreed budget.
